            <p style="margin-bottom: 14px;">Veuillez noter qu'il n'y a aucun avantage à déposer plus de <strong>1 000 €</strong> à ce stade. Au contraire, nous recommandons fortement de ne pas dépasser ce montant pour le moment.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 14px;">La prochaine étape du processus (Étape 7) inclut un trade de vérification obligatoire requis par le broker dans le cadre de leur procédure anti-bot et de validation de compte. Ce trade doit être placé avec une taille de lot de <strong>1</strong>, ce qui est inhabituellement élevé pour une configuration initiale.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 14px;">À cause de cela, déposer plus de <strong>1 000 €</strong> à ce stade ne ferait qu'augmenter l'exposition inutilement, sans fournir aucun avantage.</p>
